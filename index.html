		  <h4>made by MING</h4>
		  
		        <p> In this website, we'll be talking about both the good and the bad of computer usage.</p>
		  
		  <h2>What are the environmental consequences of computer device production?</h2>
		  <p>
			  All computer problems relate to environmental pollution and health issues. By improper disposement, you can spread diseases, and therefore proper disposment is important. Computer parts are important and valuable, cost of the parts can be recycled and reused. Therefore, instead of throwing your computer out, you can recyle it and would decrease environmental issues made from disposing computers. Disposing computers have an effect on landfills, which lead to hazardous materials, they contribute to e-waste, and have an effect on greenhouse gasses.
			  
			  - Main computer impacts:
			  - energy consuption
			  - Electronic waste
			  - manufacturing process waste
			  
			  Heavy Metal Contamination: Computers contain heavy metals including lead, mercury, and cadmium. These heavy metals can leach into the ground when computers are discarded in landfills, contaminating soil and groundwater.
